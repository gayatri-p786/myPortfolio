            Hi, I'm Gayatri Patil! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm Gayatri Patil, a Computer Science enthusiast pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Southern California. 
            With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Mumbai University and a strong foundation in multiple programming languages, I've thrived in diverse tech roles, from software development at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to creating impactful solutions as a Software Developer Intern. 
            My commitment to excellence is mirrored in achievements like winning the Google DSC Solution Challenge 2021. 
            I also possess a compassionate side, having managed an education awareness campaign for Nurturing Lives. 
            This journey in technology and social impact drives my every project.

          I had the pleasure of working with Gayatri during her tenure as an Education Awareness Campaign Manager at Nurturing Lives, an NGO dedicated to improving educational opportunities for underprivileged students. 
          Gayatri displayed outstanding interpersonal and communication skills, effectively engaging our target audience through social media and seminars.

          Gayatri's passion for technology and her aptitude for problem-solving were evident during her internship at KJSCE Computer Department. 
          As part of a multi-person team, she showcased exemplary leadership skills, directing the design and integration of PHP and SQL in a Faculty Documentation Portal. 
          I highly recommend Gayatri for any software development role.
